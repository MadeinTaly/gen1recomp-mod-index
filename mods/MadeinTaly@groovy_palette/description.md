Thirty more entries on the **COLORS** row for Gen1Recomp — Amiga Workbench, the C64 boot screen, a Virtual Boy, an amber terminal, and a pile of colour ideas the Game Boy never had.

They join the engine's own list rather than replacing it: same OPTIONS row, same hotkey, and the vanilla seven keep their positions.

## Use

**START → PALETTE.** Up and down walk the list; the game keeps drawing behind it, so you are looking at Pallet Town in the palette rather than at a menu covering it. **A** keeps it, **B** puts back the one you arrived with.

The game's own **OPTION → COLORS** row and hotkey `2` still work and still cycle the same list.

**START → MODS → Groovy Palette → OPTIONS..**

| Row | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `START MENU` | on / off | the browser above; off removes the row and the screen and leaves the palettes |
| `PACKS` | `ALL` / `RETRO` / `COLOUR` | all thirty, the twelve that are somebody's real hardware, or the eighteen invented ones |

## Why the browser is not a grid of swatches

A swatch cannot tell you what a palette does. The engine colorises at composite time — the finished 160x144 frame goes through a shade-remap — so a screen that declares itself non-opaque leaves the map, your sprite and the text box drawing underneath and gets recoloured along with them. Scrolling the list *is* the preview, at full size, on the real picture.

## What is in it

**Hardware** — AMIGA (Workbench 1.3), DPAINT, C64, SPECCY, CGA, APPLE II, POCKET, GB LIGHT, VBOY, AMBER, PHOSPHR, PLASMA.

**Colour** — RAINBOW, FUCHSIA, SUNSET, OCEAN, FOREST, LAVA, ICE, CANDY, VAPOR, NEON, TOXIC, SEPIA, NOIR, CHERRY, MIDNITE, GOLD, MINT, GRAPE.

## The one rule, and the two palettes it caught

A Game Boy pixel is one of four **shades**, and the engine feeds a palette to the shade-remap shader lightest-first. So the four colours must fall in brightness across the row — and getting that wrong does not merely look odd, it renders the game **inside out**, because the shading that describes every sprite's form is the brightness order. Thirty palettes is well past what anyone will check carefully by eye, so the test suite checks all of them by luminance. It caught two:

**AMIGA.** Workbench 1.3's four colours are grey, blue `#0055AA`, orange `#FF8800` and black. Laid out in Workbench's own order the ramp goes 170, 73, 151, 0 — the orange is brighter than the blue, so it reads inside out. Same four colours, reordered by brightness.

**VBOY.** Red carries little luminance: pure `#FF0000` is darker to the eye than mid grey, so four saturated reds collapse into mud with barely a third of the range they need. The top rung is lifted toward white-hot to buy the contrast back without letting another hue in.

## What it does not do

Four shades is four shades. These recolour the Game Boy's ramp; they do not add colours to a scene, and no palette here can show you something the original could not draw.

Nothing about the vanilla seven changes — they keep their positions, so a save pointing at SGB still lands on SGB. Disable the mod with one of its palettes saved and the game falls back to SGB: the id stops resolving and the map's own colours pass through untouched. You lose the palette, never the save.

The pack appends to `PaletteFX.MODES`, a plain module array. A future engine release could make that a registry, which would need a rewrite here.

## Requirements

Gen1Recomp and your own legally obtained Pokemon Red or Blue ROM; neither is provided here. Lua source only: no ROM, no ROM-derived data, no game assets. The palettes are original colour choices and reconstructions of other machines' hardware palettes — nothing here is extracted from a ROM.

Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Nintendo, Game Freak, or The Pokemon Company. Amiga, Commodore, Sinclair and Apple marks belong to their respective owners and are used only to say which machine a palette is imitating.
